### 1. Sites

What is the site? Sites are made up of pages. In turn, page is a bunch of text (rich text) documents.
What document? Well, let see, what we can do with pages.
Firstly, we can see that the page elements are in place. This is layout. 
Layout of the page is set up in HTML-document. # верстка настраивается HTML-документом.
HTML is HyperText Markup Language. HyperText means text in which there is a link to a resourse.
Resourses can be different types - text, audio, video, other page documents.
Resources are contained in tags and placed on the page in a certain way.
For example, <div>
                <p>Hello, buddy!</p>
             </div> means that p tag contains some tags, and div tag contains tag p.
